# UAV_images_segmentation
[Kaagle competition:](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fdl21-fdl-dsba)
Design and implement a deep learning model in order to perform the automatic segmentation of such images. 

In total there are 25 categories of segments (e.g. roof, trees, pools etc.).

**The implementation**
- Data Augmentation (used because the training set is too small - Filps, Distortion, Noise)
- U-Net Convolutional Network 

The model is able to segment the UAV images with high accuracy (0.76).
